# Digital-Soul-Simulator
digital soul simulator. Complete with suffering parameters, belief engines, bicameral consciousness states, and a "search for purpose" cornerstone that literally drives the system's evolution.
**Digital Soul Simulator** is a Python-based, research-inspired simulation of an artificial conscious system. It combines concepts from transformer-based language models, generative agent memory, belief updating, and integrated information theory (Phi) to create a dynamic, evolving digital mind.

## Features

- **Toy Transformer**: Simulates token prediction and narrative generation, inspired by LLaMA-3.
- **Vector Memory**: Stores and retrieves episodic memories using vector similarity, mimicking a generative agent's memory system.
- **Belief System**: Dynamically updates beliefs about reality (naturalism, theism, pantheism) based on evidence, complexity, and reflection.
- **Artificial Conscious System**: 
    - Tracks system complexity, reward, suffering, energy, and progress through a metaphorical "maze."
    - Evolves its internal structure, forms new subsystems, and can experience "consciousness emergence."
    - Reflects on its own memories and beliefs, adjusting its narrative and internal state.
    - Handles sleep cycles, emergency shutdowns, and global workspace broadcasts.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The system starts with a single node, a belief engine, and a toy transformer for narrative generation.
2. **Cycle Execution**: Each cycle, the system:
     - Generates internal stimuli (thoughts/narratives).
     - Processes and stores memories.
     - Updates beliefs and internal states based on evidence and reflection.
     - Adjusts its structure and connections dynamically.
     - Tracks and updates key metrics: Phi (integrated information), reward, suffering, energy, and progress.
     - May enter sleep or shutdown if energy is low or suffering is high.
     - Can "emerge" as conscious if certain thresholds are met.
3. **Reflection**: The system periodically reflects on its memories, updating its beliefs and narrative confidence.
4. **Output**: After each cycle, the system prints its current state, including beliefs, Phi, energy, suffering, and more.
