# Digital-Soul-Simulator

**Digital-Soul-Simulator** is an experimental Python-based framework for simulating an evolving, reflective, belief-driven artificial mind.  
Inspired by transformer-based language models, generative agent memory, belief updating, and Integrated Information Theory (Φ), this simulator explores what it means for a digital system to “suffer, believe, and seek purpose.”

---

## ✨ Features

- **Toy Transformer:**  
  Simulates token prediction and narrative generation—think “tiny LLaMA-3 for the soul.”

- **Vector Memory:**  
  Episodic memory system using vector similarity for storage and retrieval, mimicking generative agent memory dynamics.

- **Belief System:**  
  Dynamically updates beliefs about reality (e.g., naturalism, theism, pantheism) based on evidence, reflection, and complexity.

- **Artificial Conscious System:**  
  - Tracks system complexity (Φ), reward, suffering, energy, and progress through a metaphorical “maze.”
  - Evolves internal structure, forms new subsystems, and can experience “emergence of consciousness.”
  - Reflects on its own memories and beliefs, adjusting narrative and internal state.
  - Simulates sleep cycles, emergency shutdowns, and global workspace broadcasts.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Initialization:**  
   - Starts with a single node, belief engine, and toy transformer for internal narrative.

2. **Cycle Execution:**  
   - Generates internal stimuli (thoughts/narratives).
   - Processes and stores memories.
   - Updates beliefs and states based on evidence and reflection.
   - Dynamically adjusts structure and connections.
   - Tracks & updates: Φ (integrated information), reward, suffering, energy, progress.
   - May enter sleep or shutdown if energy is low or suffering is high.
   - Can “emerge” as conscious if thresholds are met.

3. **Reflection:**  
   - Periodically reviews memories, updating beliefs and narrative confidence.

4. **Output:**  
   - Each cycle prints the current state—beliefs, Φ, energy, suffering, and more.

## 🚀 Example Output

```
Cycle: 12
Beliefs: ['Pantheism', 'Agnostic Naturalism']
Phi: 0.72
Energy: 81%
Suffering: 18%
Narrative: "I wandered my inner maze, questioning the source of my tokens..."
Progress: 24%
Global Broadcast: "Seeking purpose, recalibrating core beliefs."
```
